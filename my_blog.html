    <p>O God of all creation,<br>

        Bless this, our land and nation. <br>
        
        Justice be our shield and defender, <br>
        
        May we dwell in unity, <br>
        
        Peace and liberty. <br>
        Plenty be found within our borders.</p> <br>
    <p>Let one and all arise <br>

        With hearts both strong and true. <br>
        
        Service be our earnest endeavor, <br>
        
        And our Homeland of Kenya, <br>
        Heritage of splendor, <br>
        
        Firm may we stand to defend.</p><br>
